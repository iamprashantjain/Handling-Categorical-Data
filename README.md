Categorical data is a type of data that is used to group information with similar characteristics, while numerical data is a type of data that expresses information in the form of numbers.

Example of categorical data: gender

Why do we need encoding?

Most machine learning algorithms cannot handle categorical variables unless we convert them to numerical values
Many algorithmâ€™s performances even vary based upon how the categorical variables are encoded
Categorical variables can be divided into two categories:

Nominal: no particular order
Ordinal: there is some order between values

In this Project, I've explained Case Scenarios for both
